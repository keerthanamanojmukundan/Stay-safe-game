# Stay-safe-game
A stay safe runner game is a type of video game where the player controls a character that automatically
runs forward and must avoid obstacles or enemies to progress. The intended game system of an stay safe
game typically involves simple controls, such as swiping or tapping on the screen to move the character up
or down, and timing jumps or slides to avoid obstacles. The game often features a variety of levels or
environments, each with its own set of obstacles and challenges. The goal is to keep running and avoid
obstacles for as long as possible, with the ultimate goal of achieving a high score.
